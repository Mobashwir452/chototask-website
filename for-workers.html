                <h2>Your Guide to Earning</h2>
                <p>This guide covers the complete workflow for workers on ChotoTask.</p>
                <h3>1. Finding and Starting a Task</h3>
                <p>From your dashboard, navigate to the "Find Tasks" page. You can filter tasks by category or payment amount. When you find a task you like, click "View Details" to read the instructions carefully. If you understand the requirements, click "Start Task" to begin.</p>
                <h3>2. Submitting Proof</h3>
                <p>After completing a task, you must submit proof. The submission page will specify what kind of proof is required (e.g., a screenshot, a text snippet, or a link). Be sure to provide accurate and clear proof to ensure your submission is approved.</p>
                <h3>3. Earnings and Withdrawals</h3>
                <p>Once a client approves your work, the payment is instantly credited to your "Wallet". You can view your total earnings and transaction history there. When you're ready to cash out, go to the "Withdraw" page and submit a request. Withdrawals are typically processed within 24-48 hours.</p>
